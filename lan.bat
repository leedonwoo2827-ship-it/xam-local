REM XAM LOCAL - SHARE ON THE OFFICE LAN (read-only for everyone else)
REM
REM Use this when you want colleagues to LOOK at the console - the screens, the
REM progress, the publish checklist. They cannot change anything:
REM
REM     you (127.0.0.1)      full access, exactly like run.bat
REM     everyone else        GET / HEAD only. Saves, builds and renders get 403.
REM
REM The rule lives in core\lan.py and is enforced by a middleware in app.py, so
REM it holds no matter how the server was started. This file only changes the
REM bind address from 127.0.0.1 to 0.0.0.0.
REM
REM ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
REM  WHAT THIS IS NOT
REM
REM  There is no password. Anyone who can reach this PC on the network can read
REM  every screen - questions, answers, explanations, the whole bank. That is
REM  fine on a trusted office LAN and NOT fine anywhere else. Never port-forward
REM  this, never run it on hotel or cafe wifi.
REM
REM  Windows Firewall will ask for permission the first time. Allow it for
REM  PRIVATE networks only - never Public.

echo   You, on this PC:
echo     http://127.0.0.1:%PORT%/

echo   Give colleagues one of these:
venv\Scripts\python -m core.lan
